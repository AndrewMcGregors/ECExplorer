#	EC Explorer
<p>
 	EC Explorer is similar to EC Navigator but is written in  C#.  In order
to run EC Explorer, it is necessary the Microsoft .NET Framework 4 or above. In 
order to create your own compilation, it is required the OpenHardwareMonitorLib 
library and a C# compiler. It works fine under Windows XP, Vista ... Windows 10. 
	I hope you enjoy it.
